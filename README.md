## Problem Formulation ##  
In this project, we are interested in finding out how different factors affect one's income. We felt that this will serve useful for people who wish to enter a new industry and would like to know, with their characteristics, what is the rough income they can expect to receive. We aim to create a classification model that will take in the features of an individual and predict an income class. Hence, the questions we aim to answer through our project are:
- What are the most important factors in determining one's income?
- Can we create a ML model to classify one's potential income to an income range based on his/her information?

## Data Source ##  
To address our problem, we have used the the Annual Social and Economic Supplements from the United States' Census Bureau Current Population Survey 2021. This dataset provides us with data of American and a wide range of their information, from innate characteristics (race, gender etc) to education attaintment to familial information, as well as their corresponding income.
