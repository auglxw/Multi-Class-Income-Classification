**SC1015 Project - Income Determinants**  
Welcome to our repository! Our team comprises of Ryan, Teg and Augustine. This is our project from SC1015: Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

**Problem Formulation**  
In this project, we are interested in finding out how different factors affect one's income. We felt that this will serve useful for people who wish to enter a new industry and would like to know, with their characteristics, what is the rough income they can expect to receive. We aim to create a classification model that will take in the features of an individual and predict an income class.

**Data Source**  
To address our problem, we have used the the Annual Social and Economic Supplements from the United States' Census Bureau Current Population Survey 2021. This dataset provides us with data of American and a wide range of their information, from innate characteristics (race, gender etc) to education attaintment to familial information, as well as their corresponding income.
